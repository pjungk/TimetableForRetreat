# TimeTable
Creating a Timetable from a JSON-File with some extra FUNctions

The link to the online JSON-file can manually be changed by tapping the first label for the times on the left side.
Tapping the upper left rectangle leads to an extra View where images, audio files, video files and other text can be shown as linked in the "Memes" list of the JSON-file.
